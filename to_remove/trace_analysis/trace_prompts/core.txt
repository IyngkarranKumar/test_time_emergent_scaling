Given a chain of reasoning, we have identified several steps we would like you to
tag. The steps are as follows:
1. Problem definition (denoted by <DEFINE> tags). This cycle redefines the
problem to answer and often ends by indicating what it needs to deliver as the
final answer, e.g., “I need to find ...”. This step does not contain any reasoning
towards a solution. There is only one Definition step.
2. The Blooming Step (denoted by <BLOOM> tags) First cycle of reasoning.
This includes an initial exploration of the problem and defines some premises,
by breaking the problem into subproblems. It must give an answer to the given
question and may or may not qualify its confidence with something like ”That
sounds right” or ”That doesn’t make sense”. There
is only one Bloom step.
3. Reconsideration Step(s) (denoted by <CYCLE> tags). These stages reconsider
some of the initial assumptions, double-check a potential error, or introduce a new
approach to solve the problem.
Through this cycle of reasoning, an answer may be reached. It may or may not
end with some confidence qualification in the answer.
There may be several reasoning cycles.
4. Final decision (denoted by <FINAL> tags) A final answer is reached. This
may be indicated by a phrase like “I’m confident...” and denotes the final answer.
There is only one Final step.

The stage may change within a single paragraph. We have annotated {N_EXAMPLES} example(s) for you here:

{EXAMPLE1}
{EXAMPLE2}
{EXAMPLE3}

Additionally, sometimes the reasoning chains get repetitive, with the same sequence(s) of text constantly being repeated. When this happens, do not annotate the repeating text. Tag the repetitive text with <REPETITION> tags, and do NOT annotate further. It is essential that you put <REPETITION> tags infront of the repetitive parts so I know which parts of the text to process. Here are {N_REPETITION_EXAMPLES} example(s) of how to handle repetitive text. 

{EXAMPLE_REPETITION_1}
{EXAMPLE_REPETITION_2}

Now, please annotate this chain of reasoning following the previous examples. Only add the tags. Do not otherwise modify the provided text:
