<DEFINE>
Okay, so I have this problem about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. The operator is represented by a 2x2 matrix Ay, which is equal to c times S, where c is h over 4π. The matrix S is given as having the first row [0, -i] and the second row [i, 0]. I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay and determine which statement among A, B, C, D is correct.
</DEFINE>


<BLOOM>
First, let me recall that for angular momentum operators, the components usually satisfy the commutation relations, but since this is a 2x2 matrix, it's similar to spin-½ particles. The Pauli matrices come to mind. Let me write down matrix S:


S = [ [0, -i],
       [i,  0] ]


So, Ay = c * S, which is (h/(4π)) * S.


To find the eigenvalues, I need to solve the characteristic equation det(Ay - aI) = 0. So, let's write Ay as:


Ay = (h/(4π)) * [ [0, -i],
                  [i,  0] ]


So, Ay is:


[ [0, -i*(h/(4π))],
  [i*(h/(4π)), 0] ]


Let me denote c = h/(4π) for simplicity. Then Ay becomes:


[ [0, -i c],
  [i c, 0] ]


The characteristic equation is determinant of (Ay - a I) = 0:


| -a    -i c       |
| i c    -a      | = 0


So, the determinant is (-a)(-a) - (-i c)(i c) = a² - ( (-i)(i) c² ) = a² - ( (-i²) c² ) = a² - ( (-(-1)) c² ) because i² is -1.


Wait, let's compute (-i c)(i c):


(-i c)(i c) = (-i)(i) c² = (-i²) c² = (-(-1))c² = c².


So, the determinant is a² - c² = 0.


Therefore, a² = c², so a = ±c.


So the eigenvalues are a = c and a = -c. Since c is h/(4π), the eigenvalues are h/(4π) and -h/(4π).


Wait, but h is Planck's constant. Maybe it's better to write it in terms of ħ (h-bar), but since the problem uses h, I'll stick with h.


So, the eigenvalues are ±h/(4π). Let me note that.


Now, looking at the options:


A) The imaginary part of the eigenvalue of Ay are +1/2 or –1/2, and the real part of that are +1 or –1.


Hmm, eigenvalues are real numbers here, since the matrix Ay is Hermitian. Let me check if Ay is Hermitian. The matrix S is:


[0, -i]
[i, 0]


Its conjugate transpose is:


[0, i]
[-i, 0]


Which is equal to S, because S^† = S. So, S is Hermitian, and since Ay = c S, Ay is also Hermitian. Therefore, eigenvalues must be real. So the eigenvalues are ±h/(4π). So statement A is talking about imaginary parts, which can't be since eigenvalues are real. So A is incorrect.


B) The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.


Hmm, the eigenfunctions would be eigenvectors corresponding to each eigenvalue. The matrix Ay is 2x2, so it has two eigenvectors. These eigenvectors are the basis functions. So yes, the eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator. So B seems correct? Wait, the statement says "the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above." Wait, the matrix operator Ay is given, and its eigenvectors are the basis functions. So B is correct? Maybe.


C) The imaginary part of the eigenvalue of Ay are +2πh or –2πh, and the real part of that are +h/4π or –h/4π.


Again, eigenvalues are real, so this is incorrect because it's talking about imaginary parts. So C is wrong.


D) The eigenfunction of the operator Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A², but not of the Z-component, Az.


Wait, A² would be the square of the angular momentum operator. For spin-½ particles, the total angular momentum squared is (ħ² s(s+1)) for s=½, which is (3/4)ħ². But here, since Ay is the Y-component, and in general, for angular momentum, the components don't commute, so an eigenstate of Ay is not an eigenstate of Az or Ax. However, the eigenfunctions of Ay would be eigenfunctions of A² because A² commutes with each component squared? Wait, no. Actually, A² commutes with each component because A² is the sum of the squares, but A² commutes with each component operator only if they are simultaneously diagonalizable, which they aren't except for A² and one component.


Wait, no, in general, A² commutes with each component, but each component does not commute with the others. So, the eigenfunctions of Ay are also eigenfunctions of A². Because A² and Ay share eigenfunctions. So, statement D says the eigenfunction can also be an eigenfunction of A², which is true, and not of Az, which is also true because Ay and Az don't commute. So D is correct.
</BLOOM>




Wait, but I thought the eigenfunctions of Ay are also eigenfunctions of A², so D is correct. So, is D correct?
</BLOOM>


<CYCLE>
But wait, earlier, I thought B might be correct as well. Let's re-examine.


Statement B: The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.


But the basis functions are the standard basis vectors, like [1,0] and [0,1], but the eigenvectors of Ay are not necessarily the standard basis. Let's compute them.


So, for eigenvalue a = c:


(Ay - c I) φ = 0.


So, matrix Ay - c I is:


[ -c, -i c ]
[ i c, -c ]


So, the equations are:


- c φ₁ - i c φ₂ = 0
i c φ₁ - c φ₂ = 0


From first equation: -c φ₁ - i c φ₂ = 0 => φ₁ = -i φ₂


Second equation: i c φ₁ - c φ₂ = 0 => i φ₁ - φ₂ = 0 => φ₂ = i φ₁


So, substituting φ₁ = -i φ₂ into second equation:


φ₂ = i (-i φ₂) = (-i²) φ₂ = (1) φ₂ => φ₂ = φ₂, which is consistent.


So, eigenvectors are proportional to [ -i, 1 ] or [1, i ].


Similarly, for eigenvalue a = -c:


Ay + c I = [ c, -i c; i c, c ]


So, equations:


c φ₁ - i c φ₂ = 0
i c φ₁ + c φ₂ = 0


From first equation: φ₁ = i φ₂


Second equation: i c φ₁ + c φ₂ = 0 => i φ₁ + φ₂ = 0 => φ₂ = -i φ₁


Substituting φ₁ = i φ₂ into second equation: φ₂ = -i (i φ₂) = -i² φ₂ = φ₂, consistent.


So, eigenvectors are [ i, 1 ] or [1, -i ].


So, the eigenfunctions are these vectors, which are not the standard basis vectors [1,0] and [0,1]. Therefore, statement B says that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions, which is incorrect because the basis functions are [1,0] and [0,1], whereas the eigenvectors are [1, i] and [1, -i], or something like that. So, B is incorrect.


Therefore, B is wrong.
</CYCLE>


<CYCLE>
Statement D is correct because the eigenfunctions are eigenfunctions of A² (since A² commutes with Ay) but not of Az, since Az doesn't commute with Ay.


So, the correct statement is D.


Wait, but let me make sure about A². A² is Ay² + Az² + Ax². Since Ay is part of the angular momentum operator, the eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A² because A² is the Casimir operator and commutes with each component. Therefore, yes, they share eigenfunctions.


So, D is correct.


Therefore, the correct answer is D.


**Final Answer**


\boxed{D}



To find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator \( A_y \), we start with the matrix representation of \( A_y \):


\[ A_y = \frac{h}{4\pi} S \]
where \( S \) is the given matrix:
\[ S = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix} \]


Thus, \( A_y \) is:
\[ A_y = \frac{h}{4\pi} \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix} \]


To find the eigenvalues, we solve the characteristic equation:
\[ \det(A_y - aI) = 0 \]


Substituting \( A_y \):
\[ \det\left( \begin{pmatrix} -a & -i \frac{h}{4\pi} \\ i \frac{h}{4\pi} & -a \end{pmatrix} \right) = 0 \]


The determinant is:
\[ (-a)(-a) - (-i \frac{h}{4\pi})(i \frac{h}{4\pi}) = a^2 - \left( \frac{h}{4\pi} \right)^2 = 0 \]


Solving for \( a \):
\[ a^2 = \left( \frac{h}{4\pi} \right)^2 \]
\[ a = \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \]


The eigenvalues are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \), which are real. Therefore, any statement about imaginary parts is incorrect.


Next, we check the eigenfunctions. For \( a = \frac{h}{4\pi} \), solving \( (A_y - \frac{h}{4\pi}I)\phi = 0 \) gives eigenvectors proportional to \( \begin{pmatrix} -i \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \) or \( \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ i \end{pmatrix} \). For \( a = -\frac{h}{4\pi} \), solving \( (A_y + \frac{h}{4\pi}I)\phi = 0 \) gives eigenvectors proportional to \( \begin{pmatrix} i \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \) or \( \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -i \end{pmatrix} \).


The eigenfunctions are not the standard basis vectors, so statement B is incorrect. The eigenfunctions are eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \) (since \( A^2 \) commutes with \( A_y \)) but not of \( A_z \) (since \( A_y \) and \( A_z \) do not commute). Thus, statement D is correct.


The correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{D}
\] Hmm, but let me keep thinking... Wait, no, in the reasoning above, I concluded D is correct, but in the final answer, I wrote B. That must be a mistake. Let me correct that.


Wait, no, actually, in the detailed reasoning, I concluded that D is correct, so the final answer should be D. So, I must have made a mistake in the last line.
