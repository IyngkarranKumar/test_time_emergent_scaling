QUESTION:
A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber. How
many bolts in total does it take? Please reason step by step, and put your final
answer within \boxed{}.


ANNOTATED REASONING CHAIN:
<DEFINE>Okay, so I’ve got this math problem here: "A robe takes 2 bolts
of blue fiber and half that much white fiber. How many bolts in total does
it take?" Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step. I’m not super
confident with these kinds of problems, but I’ll take it slowly.
First, let me parse the problem. It says a robe requires 2 bolts of blue
fiber and half that much white fiber. So, blue fiber is one part, and white
fiber is another part. I need to find the total number of bolts needed for
both.</DEFINE>
<BLOOM>Alright, so let me break it down. The problem mentions two types of fibers:
blue and white. It gives me the quantity for blue fiber first: 2 bolts.
Then, for white fiber, it says half that much. Hmm, half that much of what?
I think it means half of the blue fiber’s amount.
So, if blue fiber is 2 bolts, then half of that would be 2 divided by 2,
which is 1. So, white fiber is 1 bolt. Therefore, the total number of bolts
would be blue plus white, which is 2 plus 1. That gives me 3 bolts in total.</BLOOM>
<CYCLE>Wait, let me make sure I’m not making a mistake here. The problem says "half
that much white fiber." So, "that much" refers to the blue fiber, right? So,
if blue is 2, then half of blue is 1. So, white is 1. So, 2 + 1 is indeed
3. That seems straightforward.
But, hold on, let me think again. Is there another way to interpret this?
Maybe "half that much" could mean half of something else? Let me reread
the problem: "A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white
fiber." Hmm, it doesn’t specify the total number of fibers or anything else.
So, it’s just blue is 2, white is half of that, so 1. Total is 3.
Alternatively, could it be that "half that much" is referring to something
else, like half of the total? But the sentence structure doesn’t support
that. It says "half that much white fiber," with "that much" referring back
to the blue fiber. So, yeah, 2 is the amount of blue, white is half of that,
so 1. Total is 3.</CYCLE>
<FINAL>I think I’m confident now. So, 2 bolts of blue and 1 bolt of white make 3
bolts in total. So, the answer should be 3.
**Final Answer** The total number of bolts needed is 3. 
The problem states that a robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber. 1.
The amount of blue fiber needed is 2 bolts. 2. The amount of white fiber needed is half of the
blue fiber: 2
2 = 1 bolt. 3. Adding the blue and white fibers together gives the total number
of bolts: 2 + 1 = 3.
Thus, the total number of bolts needed is \boxed{3}
</FINAL>
