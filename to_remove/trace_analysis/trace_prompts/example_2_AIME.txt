<DEFINE>
Okay, so I have this problem: I need to find the largest possible real part of the expression \((75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z}\), where \(z\) is a complex number with \(|z| = 4\). Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but let me try to break it down step by step.
</DEFINE>

<BLOOM>
First, since \(|z| = 4\), that means \(z\) lies on a circle in the complex plane with radius 4 centered at the origin. So, I can represent \(z\) as \(4e^{i\theta}\) where \(\theta\) is the argument of \(z\). That might make it easier to handle because exponentials are often simpler to manipulate.


So, let me write \(z = 4e^{i\theta}\). Then, \(\frac{1}{z}\) would be \(\frac{1}{4}e^{-i\theta}\) because \(1/z = \overline{z}/|z|^2\), and since \(|z| = 4\), it's \(\overline{z}/16\), but since \(z = 4e^{i\theta}\), \(\overline{z} = 4e^{-i\theta}\), so \(1/z = \frac{4e^{-i\theta}}{16} = \frac{1}{4}e^{-i\theta}\). Okay, that seems right.


Now, let me substitute \(z = 4e^{i\theta}\) into the expression:


\[
(75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z}
\]


Substituting \(z\), we get:


\[
(75 + 117i)(4e^{i\theta}) + \frac{96 + 144i}{4e^{i\theta}} = (75 + 117i)(4e^{i\theta}) + (96 + 144i)\cdot \frac{1}{4}e^{-i\theta}
\]


Simplify each term:


First term: \( (75 + 117i) \times 4e^{i\theta} = 4(75 + 117i)e^{i\theta} \)


Second term: \( (96 + 144i) \times \frac{1}{4}e^{-i\theta} = (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta} \)


So, the expression becomes:


\[
4(75 + 117i)e^{i\theta} + (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta}
\]


Let me compute each multiplication separately.


First, compute \(4(75 + 117i)\):


\(4 \times 75 = 300\)


\(4 \times 117i = 468i\)


So, \(4(75 + 117i) = 300 + 468i\)


Similarly, compute \(24 + 36i\):


That's just \(24 + 36i\), nothing to do here.


So, the expression is:


\[
(300 + 468i)e^{i\theta} + (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta}
\]


Now, I need to compute the real part of this expression because the problem asks for the largest possible real part. So, let me denote the expression as \(A e^{i\theta} + B e^{-i\theta}\), where \(A = 300 + 468i\) and \(B = 24 + 36i\).


To find the real part, I can use Euler's formula: \(e^{i\theta} = \cos\theta + i\sin\theta\) and \(e^{-i\theta} = \cos\theta - i\sin\theta\). So, let's compute each term:


First term: \( (300 + 468i)(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) \)


Multiply this out:


\(300\cos\theta + 300i\sin\theta + 468i\cos\theta + 468i^2\sin\theta\)


Since \(i^2 = -1\), this becomes:


\(300\cos\theta + 300i\sin\theta + 468i\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta\)


Combine like terms:


Real parts: \(300\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta\)


Imaginary parts: \(300\sin\theta + 468\cos\theta\)


Similarly, the second term: \( (24 + 36i)(\cos\theta - i\sin\theta) \)


Multiply this out:


\(24\cos\theta - 24i\sin\theta + 36i\cos\theta - 36i^2\sin\theta\)


Again, \(i^2 = -1\), so:


\(24\cos\theta - 24i\sin\theta + 36i\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta\)


Combine like terms:


Real parts: \(24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta\)


Imaginary parts: \(-24\sin\theta + 36\cos\theta\)


Now, add the real parts from both terms:


First term's real part: \(300\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta\)


Second term's real part: \(24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta\)


Total real part:


\( (300 + 24)\cos\theta + (-468 + 36)\sin\theta = 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta \)


So, the real part of the entire expression is \(324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta\).


Now, I need to find the maximum value of this expression with respect to \(\theta\). That is, I need to find the maximum of \(324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta\). 


Hmm, okay, this is a linear combination of sine and cosine, which can be rewritten as a single sinusoidal function. The maximum of \(A\cos\theta + B\sin\theta\) is \(\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}\). Wait, but here it's \(324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta\), which is of the form \(A\cos\theta + B\sin\theta\) with \(A = 324\) and \(B = -432\). So, the maximum value is \(\sqrt{324^2 + (-432)^2}\).


Let me compute that:


First, compute \(324^2\):


\(324 \times 324\). Let me compute this step by step.


324 * 324:


First, compute 300*300 = 90,000


Then, 300*24 = 7,200


24*300 = 7,200


24*24 = 576


Wait, no, that's not the right way. Alternatively, 324^2:


Compute (300 + 24)^2 = 300^2 + 2*300*24 + 24^2 = 90,000 + 14,400 + 576 = 90,000 + 14,400 = 104,400; 104,400 + 576 = 104,976.


Similarly, compute (-432)^2 = 432^2.


432^2: Let's compute (400 + 32)^2 = 400^2 + 2*400*32 + 32^2 = 160,000 + 25,600 + 1,024 = 160,000 + 25,600 = 185,600; 185,600 + 1,024 = 186,624.


So, \(324^2 = 104,976\) and \(432^2 = 186,624\). Therefore, the sum is 104,976 + 186,624 = 291,600.


So, the maximum value is \(\sqrt{291,600}\). Let's compute that.


Well, 540^2 = 291,600 because 500^2 = 250,000, 40^2 = 1,600, and 2*500*40 = 40,000. So, 500 + 40 squared is 540^2 = (500 + 40)^2 = 500^2 + 2*500*40 + 40^2 = 250,000 + 40,000 + 1,600 = 291,600. So, sqrt(291,600) is 540.


Therefore, the maximum real part is 540.

Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check. So, the expression \(324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta\) can be written as \(R\cos(\theta + \phi)\), where \(R = \sqrt{324^2 + 432^2}\). Which is 540, as above. So, the maximum value is 540. So, the maximum real part is 540.


But wait, hold on, is that correct? Because \(324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta\) is of the form \(A\cos\theta + B\sin\theta\), but with B negative. So, the maximum is indeed \(\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}\), regardless of the sign. So, yes, 540 is correct.


So, the maximum real part is 540. Therefore, the answer is 540, which is an integer between 0 and 999. So, in the required format, it's 540, so we write it as 540.
</CYCLE>


<CYCLE>
Wait, but let me think again. Is there another way this could be approached? Maybe using derivatives or something else?


Alternatively, since \(z\) is on the circle of radius 4, we can parametrize \(z = 4e^{i\theta}\), as I did before, then the expression becomes \( (75 + 117i)4e^{i\theta} + (96 + 144i)e^{-i\theta}/4 \). Then, taking the real part, we get 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta, as above. So, the maximum is 540.


Alternatively, maybe consider \(z\) as \(x + yi\), with \(x^2 + y^2 = 16\), but that might complicate things because then you have to deal with real and imaginary parts in terms of x and y, which could get messy.


Alternatively, perhaps think of the expression as \( (75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z} \). Since \(|z| = 4\), then \(\frac{1}{z} = \frac{\overline{z}}{16}\). So, maybe express the entire expression in terms of \(z\) and \(\overline{z}\), but that might not necessarily make it easier.


Alternatively, perhaps consider that \( (75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z} \) is a complex number, and we need its real part. So, to maximize the real part, perhaps set up the expression as a function of \(\theta\) and then take its derivative with respect to \(\theta\), set it to zero, and find the maximum.


But wait, I already did that by expressing it as a single sinusoid, which gives the maximum amplitude. So, that should suffice.


Alternatively, if I'm still unsure, I can compute the derivative of \(324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta\) with respect to \(\theta\):


The derivative is \(-324\sin\theta - 432\cos\theta\). Setting this equal to zero:


\(-324\sin\theta - 432\cos\theta = 0\)


Which simplifies to:


\(324\sin\theta + 432\cos\theta = 0\)


Divide both sides by 108:


\(3\sin\theta + 4\cos\theta = 0\)


So, \(3\sin\theta = -4\cos\theta\)


Divide both sides by \(\cos\theta\) (assuming \(\cos\theta \neq 0\)):


\(3\tan\theta = -4\)


So, \(\tan\theta = -4/3\)


Therefore, \(\theta = \arctan(-4/3)\). That is, in the second or fourth quadrant.


Compute the critical points:


So, \(\theta = \pi - \arctan(4/3)\) or \(\theta = 2\pi - \arctan(4/3)\).


Compute the value of the real part at these points.


But perhaps it's easier to use the identity that the maximum of \(A\cos\theta + B\sin\theta\) is \(\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}\). So, since \(A = 324\) and \(B = -432\), the maximum is \(\sqrt{324^2 + 432^2}\), which we already found as 540. So, regardless of the specific \(\theta\), the maximum is 540.


Therefore, I think 540 is indeed the correct answer. So, the largest possible real part is 540.

Given the problem of finding the largest possible real part of the expression \((75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z}\) where \(z\) is a complex number with \(|z| = 4\), we start by representing \(z\) as \(4e^{i\theta}\). 


Substituting \(z = 4e^{i\theta}\) into the expression, we get:


\[
(75 + 117i)4e^{i\theta} + \frac{96 + 144i}{4e^{i\theta}}
\]


Simplifying each term, we have:


\[
(300 + 468i)e^{i\theta} + (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta}
\]


Using Euler's formula, we express \(e^{i\theta}\) and \(e^{-i\theta}\) in terms of cosine and sine:


\[
(300 + 468i)(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) + (24 + 36i)(\cos\theta - i\sin\theta)
\]


Expanding and combining like terms, we find the real part of the expression:


\[
324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta
\]


To find the maximum value of this expression, we use the identity for the maximum of a linear combination of sine and cosine, which is \(\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}\). Here, \(A = 324\) and \(B = -432\), so:


\[
\sqrt{324^2 + 432^2} = \sqrt{104976 + 186624} = \sqrt{291600} = 540
\]


Thus, the largest possible real part is 540.


\[
\boxed{540}
\] Hmm, but let me keep thinking... Wait, the final answer is supposed to be a 3-digit number, so 540 is already a 3-digit number, so I think that's correct. Hmm, but let me keep thinking... Wait, no, 540 is correct because the maximum real part is indeed 540. Yeah, I think that's right.
