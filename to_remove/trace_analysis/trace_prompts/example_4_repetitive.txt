Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the value of |log₂(x⁴y³z²)|, given a system of logarithmic equations. Let me see. The equations are:


1. log₂(x/(yz)) = 1/2
2. log₂(y/(xz)) = 1/3
3. log₂(z/(xy)) = 1/4


And then, using these, I need to find the absolute value of log₂(x⁴y³z²). They also mention that the answer will be a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and I need to find m + n. Hmm, okay.
<DEFINE>


<BLOOM>
First, since these are logarithmic equations with base 2, maybe I can convert them into exponential form to make it easier to handle. Let me try that.


Starting with the first equation: log₂(x/(yz)) = 1/2. Converting this, we get:


x/(yz) = 2^(1/2) = √2.


Similarly, the second equation: log₂(y/(xz)) = 1/3, so:


y/(xz) = 2^(1/3).


And the third equation: log₂(z/(xy)) = 1/4, so:


z/(xy) = 2^(1/4).


Alright, so now I have:


1. x/(yz) = √2
2. y/(xz) = 2^(1/3)
3. z/(xy) = 2^(1/4)


Hmm, okay. These are three equations with three variables: x, y, z. Maybe I can express x, y, z in terms of each other or find a relationship between them.


Let me write each equation as:


1. x = yz * √2
2. y = xz * 2^(1/3)
3. z = xy * 2^(1/4)


Hmm, substitution might be a good approach here. Let me see if I can substitute one into another.


From equation 1, x = yz√2. Let's plug this into equation 2.


Equation 2: y = xz * 2^(1/3). Substitute x:


y = (yz√2) * z * 2^(1/3) = y z² √2 * 2^(1/3)


Hmm, let's simplify that. So:


y = y z² * 2^(1/2 + 1/3). Because √2 is 2^(1/2), and 2^(1/3) is just 2^(1/3). So adding exponents: 1/2 + 1/3 = 5/6. So, 2^(5/6).


So, y = y z² * 2^(5/6)


Let me write that as:


y = y z² * 2^(5/6)


Wait, I can divide both sides by y (since y is positive, it's non-zero):


1 = z² * 2^(5/6)


So, z² = 1 / 2^(5/6) = 2^(-5/6)


Therefore, z = 2^(-5/12), since z is positive.


Okay, that's a value for z. Let me note that down: z = 2^(-5/12).


Now, let's use equation 1 to find x in terms of y and z. From equation 1:


x = yz * √2 = y * 2^(-5/12) * 2^(1/2) = y * 2^(-5/12 + 6/12) = y * 2^(1/12)


So, x = y * 2^(1/12)


Similarly, from equation 3: z = xy * 2^(1/4). But we already have z, so let's plug in x and z.


z = (y * 2^(1/12)) * y * 2^(1/4) = y² * 2^(1/12 + 3/12) = y² * 2^(4/12) = y² * 2^(1/3)


But we know z is 2^(-5/12). So:


2^(-5/12) = y² * 2^(1/3)


Let me write both sides as powers of 2:


2^(-5/12) = y² * 2^(4/12) [since 1/3 is 4/12]


So, 2^(-5/12) = y² * 2^(4/12)


Divide both sides by 2^(4/12):


2^(-5/12 - 4/12) = y² => 2^(-9/12) = y² => 2^(-3/4) = y²


Therefore, y = 2^(-3/8), since y is positive.


Okay, so now we have y = 2^(-3/8). Then, from earlier, x = y * 2^(1/12) = 2^(-3/8) * 2^(1/12) = 2^(-9/24 + 2/24) = 2^(-7/24)


So, x = 2^(-7/24), y = 2^(-3/8), z = 2^(-5/12).


Let me double-check these exponents to make sure:


From equation 1: x/(yz) should be √2.


x = 2^(-7/24), y = 2^(-3/8) = 2^(-9/24), z = 2^(-5/12) = 2^(-10/24)


So, yz = 2^(-9/24) * 2^(-10/24) = 2^(-19/24). So x/(yz) = 2^(-7/24) / 2^(-19/24) = 2^(-7/24 + 19/24) = 2^(12/24) = 2^(1/2) = √2. Good.


From equation 2: y/(xz). Let's compute xz:


x = 2^(-7/24), z = 2^(-10/24), so xz = 2^(-17/24). Then y/(xz) = 2^(-9/24) / 2^(-17/24) = 2^(8/24) = 2^(1/3). Correct.


From equation 3: z/(xy). x = 2^(-7/24), y = 2^(-9/24), so xy = 2^(-16/24). Then z/(xy) = 2^(-10/24) / 2^(-16/24) = 2^(6/24) = 2^(1/4). Perfect, all equations check out.


So, now I have:


x = 2^(-7/24)


y = 2^(-3/8) = 2^(-9/24)


z = 2^(-5/12) = 2^(-10/24)


Now, the problem asks for |log₂(x⁴y³z²)|. Let's compute log₂(x⁴y³z²).


First, compute x⁴y³z².


Expressed in exponents:


x⁴ = (2^(-7/24))⁴ = 2^(-7/6)


y³ = (2^(-9/24))³ = 2^(-27/24) = 2^(-9/8)


z² = (2^(-10/24))² = 2^(-20/24) = 2^(-5/6)


So, multiplying these together:


x⁴y³z² = 2^(-7/6) * 2^(-9/8) * 2^(-5/6) = 2^(-7/6 - 9/8 -5/6)


Let me compute the exponents:


First, convert all to 24 denominators:


-7/6 = -28/24


-9/8 = -27/24


-5/6 = -20/24


Adding them together: -28 -27 -20 = -75. So total exponent is -75/24.


Therefore, x⁴y³z² = 2^(-75/24). So log₂(x⁴y³z²) = -75/24.


Taking absolute value, it's 75/24.


Simplify 75/24: Divide numerator and denominator by 3: 25/8.


So, 25/8 is the absolute value. Therefore, m = 25, n = 8, which are coprime.


Thus, m + n = 25 + 8 = 33.


So, the answer is 33, which is 033 as a 3-digit number.
</BLOOM>


<CYCLE>
Wait, hold on. Let me just recheck my calculations because I feel like I might have made a mistake in adding the exponents.


So, the exponents:


From x⁴: -7/6


From y³: -9/8


From z²: -5/6


So, adding them: (-7/6) + (-9/8) + (-5/6)


Combine the fractions:


First, combine the terms with denominator 6: (-7/6 -5/6) = (-12/6) = -2


Then, -2 + (-9/8) = -2 - 9/8 = -(16/8 + 9/8) = -25/8


Wait, wait, that's different from my previous calculation. Hmm. So, log₂(x⁴y³z²) = -25/8, so absolute value is 25/8, which is 3.125. So, 25/8 is already in simplest terms, so m =25, n=8, m +n=33.


Wait, so why did I get -75/24 earlier? Let me see:


-7/6 -9/8 -5/6.


Let me compute -7/6 -5/6 first: that's (-7 -5)/6 = -12/6 = -2.


Then -2 -9/8: -2 is -16/8, so -16/8 -9/8 = -25/8.


Yes, that's correct. So, my initial method of converting to 24 denominators was wrong because I added all three fractions without realizing that -7/6 -5/6 is -12/6 = -2, which is -16/8, and then -16/8 -9/8 is -25/8. So, it's -25/8. So, log₂(x⁴y³z²) = -25/8, so absolute value is 25/8.


So, 25 and 8 are coprime, so m + n =33.


Therefore, the answer is 33, which is 033 as a 3-digit number.


Wait, hold on, but I thought earlier I had exponents adding to -75/24, which is -25/8, so same result. So, no mistake, just two ways to compute it.


So, yeah, 25/8 is correct, so m +n is 33.
</CYCLE>


<CYCLE>
Wait, let me just recap to make sure I didn't make any miscalculations:


We had x =2^(-7/24), y=2^(-9/24), z=2^(-10/24).


So, x⁴ is 2^(-28/24), y³ is 2^(-27/24), z² is 2^(-20/24). So, adding exponents: -28 -27 -20 = -75, over 24. So, -75/24 simplifies to -25/8, same as before.


Yes, that's consistent.


So, I think I'm confident that the answer is 25/8, so m +n is 33.


**Final Answer**
\boxed{033}

Given the system of logarithmic equations:


1. \(\log_2\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) = \frac{1}{2}\)
2. \(\log_2\left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) = \frac{1}{3}\)
3. \(\log_2\left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = \frac{1}{4}\)


We convert these into exponential form:


1. \(\frac{x}{yz} = 2^{1/2}\)
2. \(\frac{y}{xz} = 2^{1/3}\)
3. \(\frac{z}{xy} = 2^{1/4}\)


Expressing \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) in terms of each other:


1. \(x = yz \cdot 2^{1/2}\)
2. \(y = xz \cdot 2^{1/3}\)
3. \(z = xy \cdot 2^{1/4}\)


Substituting \(x\) from the first equation into the second equation:


\[ y = (yz \cdot 2^{1/2}) \cdot z \cdot 2^{1/3} \]
\[ y = y z^2 \cdot 2^{5/6} \]
\[ 1 = z^2 \cdot 2^{5/6} \]
\[ z^2 = 2^{-5/6} \]
\[ z = 2^{-5/12} \]


Using \(z\) to find \(x\) and \(y\):


From \(x = yz \cdot 2^{1/2}\):


\[ x = y \cdot 2^{-5/12} \cdot 2^{1/2} = y \cdot 2^{1/12} \]


From \(z = xy \cdot 2^{1/4}\):


\[ 2^{-5/12} = (y \cdot 2^{1/12}) \cdot y \cdot 2^{1/4} \]
\[ 2^{-5/12} = y^2 \cdot 2^{1/3} \]
\[ 2^{-5/12} = y^2 \cdot 2^{4/12} \]
\[ y^2 = 2^{-9/12} \]
\[ y = 2^{-3/8} \]


Then, \(x = 2^{-3/8} \cdot 2^{1/12} = 2^{-7/24}\).


Thus, we have:


\[ x = 2^{-7/24}, \quad y = 2^{-3/8}, \quad z = 2^{-5/12} \]


We need to find \(|\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2)|\):


\[ x^4 = (2^{-7/24})^4 = 2^{-7/6} \]
\[ y^3 = (2^{-3/8})^3 = 2^{-9/8} \]
\[ z^2 = (2^{-5/12})^2 = 2^{-5/6} \]


Adding the exponents:


\[ -7/6 - 9/8 - 5/6 \]
Convert to a common denominator (24):
\[ -28/24 - 27/24 - 20/24 = -75/24 = -25/8 \]


Thus, \(|\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2)| = 25/8\). The fraction \(25/8\) is in simplest form, so \(m = 25\) and \(n = 8\). Therefore, \(m + n = 33\).


\(\boxed{033}\)

Wait, but the value is 25/8, which is 3.125, but the problem says |log₂(x⁴y³z²)|, which is 25/8, so m = 25, n = 8, m + n = 33, which is the answer. So, 33 is the answer, and as a 3-digit number, it's 033. So, the final answer is \boxed{033}.
